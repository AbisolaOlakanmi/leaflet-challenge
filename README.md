# leaflet-challenge

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

TASK:

1. Is to visualize an earthquake dataset. 
-Get the dataset. By following these steps:
.  The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes
.  The "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" data set was selected from the USGS GeoJSON Feed page
.  The data was given in JSON format which was used to pull in the data for the visualization

2. Import and visualize the data by doing the following:
- Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
- Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color
Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color
Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake were included when a marker is clicked
A legend was created to provide context for the map data
